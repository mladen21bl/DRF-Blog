What a contrast, at least according to the standings, is this matchup of Nuggets vs. Heat. None of that really matters anymore, not this deep into the postseason. In the NBA Finals, it\u2019s all about shot-making, defensive stands and the courage needed to become a champion. And based on what we\u2019ve seen from these two teams, both belong on the June stage.\r\n\r\nComplete coverage: 2023 NBA Finals\r\nThat\u2019s because the Nuggets and Heat just went through the fire. Denver had to cope with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker in the Western Conference semifinals, then LeBron James and Anthony Davis for the West crown.\r\n\r\nAnd Miami? After surviving the Play-In (where Miami actually trailed the Chicago Bulls late in the fourth quarter), the Heat chopped down a pair of sequoias in the Bucks and Celtics, stunning the league each time. Best of all those matchups will bring plenty of confidence because of the experiences.\r\n\r\nMaybe it\u2019s not the Finals matchup some folks wanted, but it could become the Finals matchup we deserve. What\u2019s wonderful about Nuggets-Heat is that either Nikola Jokic or Jimmy Butler will leave with a ring. There\u2019s beauty to behold in the chase for the first championship, especially because there\u2019s no guarantee either player will get this close again.", "image": "post_images/jok.jpg", "created_date": "2023-05-31T10:02:18.232Z", "slug": "1286b9759d4b7ac4fc2659ffde98e95332bbb706150d1503e8d5a3c799fc2c0d", "category_slug": "2e7746ca17e8138a7b6a7da7a6681dd2c8659f3dba4850cbcae48d76bbfcd5d7"}
