Since then, the 45-year-old found success at Hellas Verona and Olympique Marseille.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to La Provence via ilBianconero, Tudor has already decided to part ways with Marseille after securing a spot in the Champions League qualifiers.\r\n\r\nBut while this is supposed to be encouraging news for the Bianconeri faithful who were hoping to see him appointed in Turin, the source suggests an alternative path.\r\n\r\nAs the report explains, Tudor might decide to take a sabbatical to recharge his batteries after several exhausting campaigns.\r\n\r\nOM still have one match remaining in the Ligue 1 campaign, but their third-place finish is mathematically certain.", "image": "post_images/juve2.jpg", "created_date": "2023-05-31T10:00:11.377Z", "slug": "2f4aae4f11b1bf38bf66b318cab173c7ea3465967d4b0b33c64b1ae3dfa87ab5", "category_slug": "5cb481c25c9446951b1462f7c8a109c6d8b1a470ac4bdd61b287855e50bf8aae"}
