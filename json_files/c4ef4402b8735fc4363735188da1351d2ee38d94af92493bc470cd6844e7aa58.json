We are incredibly proud of the SPD in Bremen,\" the party's General Secretary Kevin K\u00fchnert enthused, after the SPD won local elections in the northern German city state on May 14.\r\n\r\nThat win was not a given. Bremen's SPD Mayor Andreas Bovenschulte rounded off his election campaign with something that sounded like a musical plea for loyalty, singing his own rendition of the 1960s Ben E. King classic \"Stand by Me.\" SPD co-chair Lars Klingbeil, who traveled from Berlin in support, accompanied him on the guitar.
